Building the docker image

# make a Dockerfile
# you are root inside docker, so no sudo ....
git clone 'docker ubuntu 14.04 image plus apt install imagemagick terreract-ocr'

# from within the directory with the Dockerfile
docker build  .

# To make a container from an image (adding a bound folder to the container)
# You can make several containers of an image, for parallel tasks
docker run -it -v {local_folder}:{name_for_folder_inside_container} {name_of_image}
docker run -it -v /home/francis/Desktop/DockerForDerivRegen/shared:/home/docker/share 21984656ae58

# To stop the container
exit

# to show what containers you have built.  they will have a nickname on the right for referencing them later.
docker ps -a 

# to see what images you've downloaded
docker images -a

# images keep the settings for shared folders, installed packages, etc.
# -i says you want a terminal open to item
docker start -i {image nickname}


Starting a container of an image

# you can start up multiple containers of the same image by:
docker run -it -v {image_nickname}


Starting scripts

# python virtualenvironments are always recommended
cd /home/docker/share
python3 -m venv python3venv
. python3venv/bin/activate
# if you want an interactive python shell
python
# or if you want to run a python script
python {name of file.py}
